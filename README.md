# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
For my first solo project hang-in-there, I was given the task to build a HTML webpage for showing, creating, deleting, and an additional section of unmotivational posters. The problems that needed to be fixed in this applicatioin was first displaying the main poster. After that I needed to be able to go between sections so the user can create posters, see their saved posters, and access the new section unmotivational posters.
### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

1. go to: https://github.com/Montana-Pfeifer/hang-in-there
2. fork/ clone repo
3. open terminal and cd into hang-in-there Directory
4. In the terminal run: open index.html

### Preview of App:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
For this project we had 9 days to complete this application. I was going to finish in the first half but took a step back and paced out the project through out the entire time we had to complete it so I would be able to look at the code everyday and determine if there need to be a refactor. This planning helped alot because I had variable I claimed and wasn't using that did need to be used in a function.
I am in my 3rd inning of turing, repeating Mod 2

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals of this project was to learn how HTML, CSS, and JS work together in a FE application.
HTML being the structure of the page, CSS how the styling is applied to the element in the HTML, and how JS works as the functionality of the page (buttons, functions, and querys elements within the HTML)

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
The two wins I had on this  project:

1. Doing this project again I had a very solid understanding of FE development, when this project wwas assigned I was halfway done with iteration 3 by the project checkin and still had a solid understanding of what needed to happen next taking it one step at a time.(It felt fast)

2. This is kind of like the first but I would say another win is being able to understand everything even after last inning and the intermission. With the ability to slow down and think more methodically before diving into anycode.

3. The one challenge I did have was the mini-posters. I fixed this by seperating unmotivational mini posters and the miniposters so when these div elements are created they dont have the same styles or functionality. I have gotten into a habit of making sure each section has it's own functionality so nothing has a chance to cross eachother and recieve an error.
